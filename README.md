# The U.S. Census Bureau API
This is a working project to help make the U.S. Census Bureau APIs more accessible via the Postman platform.

Census API Portal: https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html

Currently this project has two artifacts for the Census Bureau API:

- [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/postman-government/census/blob/master/census-openapi.yaml) - An OpenAPI definition for the Census API.
- [Postman Collection](https://github.com/postman-government/census/blob/master/Census%20Documentation%20(Generated).postman_collection.json) - A Postman collection for the Census API.

You can [view documentation for this collection here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2220438/TVCgxS4Y#intro), and if you have any feedback, comments, or questions, please feel free to submit a GitHub issue for this repository.
